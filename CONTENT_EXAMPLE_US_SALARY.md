## Understanding Your US Salary and Taxes

### Federal Income Tax (2024)

The US uses a progressive tax system with seven tax brackets for 2024:

| Tax Rate | Single Filers | Married Filing Jointly |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| 10% | $0 - $11,600 | $0 - $23,200 |
| 12% | $11,601 - $47,150 | $23,201 - $94,300 |
| 22% | $47,151 - $100,525 | $94,301 - $201,050 |
| 24% | $100,526 - $191,950 | $201,051 - $383,900 |
| 32% | $191,951 - $243,725 | $383,901 - $487,450 |
| 35% | $243,726 - $609,350 | $487,451 - $731,200 |
| 37% | Over $609,350 | Over $731,200 |

**Important:** You only pay each rate on the portion of income within that bracket, not your entire salary.

### Social Security Tax (FICA)

- **Rate:** 6.2% of gross income
- **Wage Base Limit (2024):** $168,600
- **What It Means:** You pay 6.2% on the first $168,600 of earnings, nothing above that
- **Example:** On $75,000 salary = $4,650/year in Social Security tax

### Medicare Tax

- **Rate:** 1.45% of all gross income (no limit)
- **Additional Medicare Tax:** 0.9% on income over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married)
- **Example:** On $75,000 salary = $1,087.50/year in Medicare tax

### State Income Tax

State tax varies by location:

**No State Income Tax (9 states):**
- Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming

**Lowest State Tax:**
- North Dakota (2.9% - 2.6%)
- Pennsylvania (3.07% flat)
- Indiana (3.05% flat)

**Highest State Tax:**
- California (1% - 13.3%)
- New York (4% - 10.9%)
- New Jersey (1.4% - 10.75%)

### Standard Deduction (2024)

- **Single:** $14,600
- **Married Filing Jointly:** $29,200
- **Head of Household:** $21,900

The standard deduction reduces your taxable income before calculating federal tax.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs)

### FAQ 1: How accurate is this US salary calculator?

**Answer:** Our calculator uses official 2024 IRS tax brackets, Social Security rates (6.2%), and Medicare rates (1.45%). We include all federal taxes and state-specific tax rates for all 50 states plus DC. The calculator is updated annually when the IRS releases new tax tables.

**Accuracy:** 95-98% for standard W-2 employees. Minor differences may occur due to:
- Employer-specific deductions (health insurance, etc.)
- Mid-year tax law changes
- Special tax situations (itemized deductions, credits)

---

### FAQ 2: Is this calculator free to use?

**Answer:** Yes, completely free. No signup required, no credit card needed, no hidden fees. Use it unlimited times to compare different salary scenarios, states, or deduction amounts.

---

### FAQ 3: What's the difference between gross salary and net salary?

**Answer:**

**Gross Salary** = Your annual salary before any deductions (the amount in your job offer or employment contract)

**Net Salary (Take-Home Pay)** = What you actually receive after all taxes and deductions

**Example:**
- Job offer: $80,000/year (gross)
- After federal tax (~$10,000), Social Security ($4,960), Medicare ($1,160), state tax (~$3,000)
- Take-home: ~$60,880/year or $5,073/month (net)

---

### FAQ 4: Why is my actual paycheck different from the calculator?

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Additional Deductions:**
   - Health insurance premiums
   - Dental/vision insurance
   - Life insurance
   - Retirement contributions beyond 401(k)

2. **Employer Benefits:**
   - HSA/FSA contributions
   - Commuter benefits
   - Union dues

3. **Payroll Schedule:**
   - Bi-weekly (26 paychecks) vs semi-monthly (24 paychecks)
   - Affects per-check amount, not annual total

4. **Tax Withholding Form (W-4):**
   - How you filled out your W-4 affects withholding
   - More allowances = less withholding = bigger paychecks

**Tip:** Use our calculator to verify your annual total matches. Per-paycheck amounts vary by pay schedule.

---

### FAQ 5: What is FICA and why is it on my paycheck?

**Answer:** FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) is the combined Social Security and Medicare tax.

**FICA Breakdown:**
- **Social Security:** 6.2% (up to $168,600 in 2024)
- **Medicare:** 1.45% (no limit)
- **Total FICA:** 7.65% of your gross salary

**Example on $75,000 salary:**
- Social Security: $4,650
- Medicare: $1,088
- Total FICA: $5,738/year

**What it funds:** Your future Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare health coverage.

---

### FAQ 6: How do I calculate my hourly rate from annual salary?

**Formula:** Annual Salary ÷ 2,080 hours

**Why 2,080?** = 40 hours/week × 52 weeks/year

**Examples:**
- $50,000/year = $24.04/hour
- $75,000/year = $36.06/hour
- $100,000/year = $48.08/hour
- $150,000/year = $72.12/hour

**Note:** This is your gross hourly rate. Your net (take-home) hourly rate is lower after taxes.

---

### FAQ 7: What tax bracket am I in?

**Answer:** Your tax bracket is the highest rate applied to your income, but you don't pay that rate on all your income due to progressive taxation.

**2024 Tax Brackets (Single Filers):**

| Income Range | Tax Bracket | What You Pay |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| $0 - $11,600 | 10% | 10% on this portion |
| $11,601 - $47,150 | 12% | 10% on first $11,600, then 12% |
| $47,151 - $100,525 | 22% | 10% + 12% + 22% (progressive) |
| $100,526 - $191,950 | 24% | Progressive up to 24% |
| $191,951+ | 32-37% | Progressive to top rate |

**Example:** $75,000 salary = 22% bracket
- But effective rate is only ~12% due to progressive taxation
- You pay: 10% on first $11,600 + 12% on next $35,550 + 22% on remaining

---

### FAQ 8: Should I claim 0 or 1 on my W-4?

**Answer:** The old W-4 system changed in 2020. You no longer claim "allowances."

**New W-4 Form (2024):**
- **Step 1:** Filing status (single, married, head of household)
- **Step 2:** Multiple jobs (if applicable)
- **Step 3:** Claim dependents
- **Step 4:** Other adjustments (extra withholding, deductions)

**General Guidance:**
- **Single, one job:** Fill out Steps 1 & 5, leave rest blank
- **Married, one income:** Select "Married filing jointly" in Step 1
- **Have dependents:** Complete Step 3 to reduce withholding
- **Want bigger refund:** Add extra withholding in Step 4(c)
- **Want bigger paychecks:** Add deductions in Step 4(b)

**Tip:** Use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator at irs.gov for personalized guidance.

---

### FAQ 9: What is the Social Security wage base limit?

**Answer:** In 2024, the Social Security wage base limit is **$168,600**.

**What This Means:**
- You pay 6.2% Social Security tax on earnings up to $168,600
- Any income above $168,600 is NOT subject to Social Security tax
- Medicare (1.45%) still applies to all income, no limit

**Examples:**

**Salary $75,000:**
- Social Security tax: $75,000 × 6.2% = $4,650

**Salary $200,000:**
- Social Security tax: $168,600 × 6.2% = $10,453
- (You don't pay SS tax on the remaining $31,400)

**Why it exists:** Social Security benefits are capped, so contributions are too.

---

### FAQ 10: Can I deduct my 401(k) contributions?

**Answer:** **Yes!** 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income.

**How It Works:**
- Salary: $80,000
- 401(k) contribution: $10,000
- Taxable income: $70,000 (not $80,000)
- Federal tax calculated on $70,000

**Tax Savings:**
- At 22% tax bracket: $10,000 × 22% = $2,200 saved
- At 24% tax bracket: $10,000 × 24% = $2,400 saved

**2024 Limits:**
- Standard: $23,000/year
- Age 50+: $30,500/year (includes $7,500 catch-up)

**Important:** Roth 401(k) contributions are NOT pre-tax (paid after tax, but grow tax-free).

---

### FAQ 11: How much will I pay in taxes if I live in California vs Texas?

**Answer:** California has state income tax (up to 13.3%), Texas has none (0%).

**Example: $100,000 Salary**

**Texas (No State Tax):**
- Federal tax: ~$14,260
- Social Security: $6,200
- Medicare: $1,450
- State tax: $0
- **Total taxes: $21,910 (21.9%)**
- **Take-home: $78,090**

**California (State Tax ~9.3%):**
- Federal tax: ~$14,260
- Social Security: $6,200
- Medicare: $1,450
- State tax: ~$4,800
- **Total taxes: $26,710 (26.7%)**
- **Take-home: $73,290**

**Difference:** You keep **$4,800 more per year** in Texas vs California at $100k salary.

**Note:** California offers more public services, but Texas has higher property/sales tax.

---

### FAQ 12: What is the Additional Medicare Tax?

**Answer:** High earners pay an extra 0.9% Medicare tax on income above certain thresholds.

**2024 Thresholds:**
- **Single filers:** Income over $200,000
- **Married filing jointly:** Income over $250,000
- **Married filing separately:** Income over $125,000

**How It Works:**
- Regular Medicare (1.45%) applies to ALL income
- Additional 0.9% kicks in above threshold

**Example: $250,000 salary (single):**
- Regular Medicare: $250,000 × 1.45% = $3,625
- Additional Medicare: $50,000 × 0.9% = $450
- **Total Medicare tax: $4,075**

**Note:** Employers don't match the 0.9% additional tax—you pay it yourself.
