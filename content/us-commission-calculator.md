### Common Questions

## Common Questions About US Salaries

### How much is taken out of my paycheck in United States?

For most US workers, approximately 20-35% of gross salary goes to taxes and deductions:
- **Federal Tax:** 10-37% (depends on income)
- **FICA:** 7.65%

The exact amount depends on your income level, state, and personal circumstances.

### What is gross vs net salary?

- **Gross Salary:** Your salary before any deductions (what's in your employment contract)
- **Net Salary (Take-Home Pay):** What actually arrives in your bank account after all taxes and deductions

**Example:**
- Gross: $75,000/year
- Net: ~$54,000/year
- Difference: ~$21,000 in taxes

### How do 401(k) contributions affect my take-home pay?

401(k) contributions are pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income. Contributing the maximum ($23,500 in 2026) can save you thousands in federal and state taxes while building retirement savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Is this United States salary calculator accurate?

Yes, our calculator uses official 2026 tax rates from IRS (Internal Revenue Service) and state tax authorities. We include:
- Current Federal Tax brackets
- FICA rates and caps
- States-specific tax rates
- Standard deductions and allowances

**Important:** Results are estimates for informational purposes. Your actual take-home pay may vary based on:
- Employer-specific benefits
- Additional deductions or withholdings
- Tax credits you qualify for
- Timing of payments (tax is calculated annually but paid periodically)

### How often is the calculator updated?

We update our calculator annually when new tax rates are announced. Our 2026 rates are current as of January 2026. Tax rates are typically announced in late 2025 for the 2026 tax year.

### What is FICA and how is it calculated?

FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) has two components:

**Social Security:**
- Employee pays: 6.2%
- Employer pays: 6.2%
- Wage cap: $176,100 (2026)
- Maximum annual contribution: $10,918

**Medicare:**
- Employee pays: 1.45% (no cap)
- Additional 0.9% over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married)
- Employer pays: 1.45%

**Example on $75,000 salary:**
- Social Security: $4,650 (6.2%)
- Medicare: $1,088 (1.45%)
- Total FICA: $5,738/year

Self-employed individuals pay both employee and employer portions (15.3% total).

### How do pre-tax deductions reduce my taxes?

Pre-tax deductions reduce your **taxable income**, which lowers both your income tax and FICA (Social Security/Medicare) in many cases.

**Example:** $75,000 salary, 22% tax bracket

Without 401(k):
- Taxable income: $75,000
- Federal tax: ~$11,000
- FICA: $5,738
- Take-home: ~$58,000

With $10,000 401(k) contribution:
- Taxable income: $65,000
- Federal tax: ~$8,800 (saves $2,200)
- FICA: $5,738 (same)
- Take-home: ~$51,000 + $10,000 in retirement = $61,000 net worth

**Tax savings:** $2,200 federal tax saved, plus state tax savings if applicable.

### What are standard vs itemized deductions?

**Standard Deduction (2026):**
- Single: $14,600
- Married filing jointly: $29,200
- Head of household: $21,900

Most taxpayers take the standard deduction.

**Itemized Deductions** include:
- Mortgage interest
- State and local taxes (SALT) up to $10,000
- Charitable donations
- Medical expenses over 7.5% of AGI

Itemize only if total exceeds standard deduction.

**Example:** Single filer
- Mortgage interest: $8,000
- SALT: $10,000
- Charity: $2,000
- Total: $20,000

Since $20,000 > $14,600 standard, itemizing saves ~$1,188 (22% bracket × $5,400 difference).

### FAQ placeholder

Answer placeholder

### Can I use this for self-employment (1099 contractors)?

Yes! Our calculator supports both W-2 employees and 1099 contractors. Self-employed individuals pay an additional 15.3% self-employment tax (the employer portion of FICA). Use the "Employment Type" advanced option to switch to self-employed calculations.

### How accurate are the states?

Our United States salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits
- ✅ States with standard rates

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified US tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **401(k) Contributions:** Pre-tax retirement savings (Maximum: $23,500)
- **Traditional IRA:** Individual retirement account (Maximum: $7,000)
- **HSA:** Health Savings Account (Maximum: $4,300 (single), $8,550 (family))
- **Health Insurance Premiums:** Employer-sponsored health insurance

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Federal Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (401(k) Contributions, etc.)
- State of residence

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
