### Can I use this for self-employed and contractors?

Yes! The calculator works for both employees and self-employed contractors. Self-employed individuals can deduct business expenses and contribute to RRSP. CPP rates are different (11.9% vs 5.95% employee rate) but you can claim 50% back.

### How accurate are the provinces?

Our Canada salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits
- ✅ Provinces with standard rates

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified Canadian tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **RRSP Contributions:** Registered Retirement Savings Plan (Maximum: 18% of income)
- **Union Dues:** Professional union membership fees
- **Childcare Expenses:** Eligible childcare costs

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Income Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (RRSP Contributions, etc.)
- Province of residence

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
