### Can I use this for freelancers (Freiberufler) and self-employed?

Yes! The calculator works for employees and Freiberufler (freelancers). Self-employed pay full social security contributions (~40% vs ~20% for employees) but rates vary by profession and optional insurance.

### How accurate are the calculations?

Our Germany salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits


**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified German tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Werbungskosten:** Work-related expenses (min. €1,230 automatic)
- **Sonderausgaben:** Special expenses (insurance, donations)
- **Church Tax:** 8-9% of income tax (optional)

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Income Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Werbungskosten, etc.)

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
