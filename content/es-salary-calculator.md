## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Is this Spain salary calculator accurate?

Yes, our calculator uses official 2026 tax rates from Agencia Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency). We include:
- Current IRPF brackets
- Social Security rates and caps
- Autonomous communities-specific tax rates
- Standard deductions and allowances

**Important:** Results are estimates for informational purposes. Your actual take-home pay may vary based on:
- Employer-specific benefits
- Additional deductions or withholdings
- Tax credits you qualify for
- Timing of payments (tax is calculated annually but paid periodically)

### How often is the calculator updated?

We update our calculator annually when new tax rates are announced. Our 2026 rates are current as of January 2026. Tax rates are typically announced in late 2025 for the 2026 tax year.

### What is the difference between empleado and autónomo taxation?

**Empleado (Employee):**
- IRPF: Same progressive brackets (19%-47%)
- Seguridad Social: 6.35% capped at €4,070/month (€48,840/year)
- Employer pays additional ~30% Seguridad Social
- Withholding (retención) applied monthly by employer

**Autónomo (Self-Employed):**
- IRPF: Same progressive brackets (19%-47%)
- Seguridad Social: Progressive monthly scale €230-€1,536 based on actual income
- Can deduct business expenses from IRPF
- Quarterly tax payments (trimestral)
- Must handle own tax filings

**Example: €36,000 annual income**
- Employee: €2,286 Seguridad Social, ~€7,300 IRPF = €26,414 net
- Autónomo: ~€4,080 Seguridad Social, ~€5,500 IRPF (after expenses) = ~€26,420 net

The difference is smaller than many think, but autónomos have more admin overhead.

### Can I deduct pension and health insurance?

Yes, certain contributions reduce your taxable income for IRPF:

**Pension Plans (Plan de Pensiones):**
- Maximum deduction: €1,500/year (or 30% of net income, whichever is lower)
- Additional €8,500 if over 50 years old
- Must be in approved pension plan

**Private Health Insurance:**
- Maximum deduction: €500/year per person
- €1,500 for people with disabilities
- Must cover illness or accident

**Example: €40,000 salary**
- Without deductions: €40,000 taxable
- With €1,500 pension + €500 health: €38,000 taxable
- Tax savings: ~€600 (30% bracket × €2,000)

**Important:** These deductions reduce IRPF only, not Seguridad Social.

### How do personal and family allowances work?

Spain uses personal allowances (mínimo personal) that reduce taxable income:

**Base Personal Allowance:** €5,550

**Age-Based Increases:**
- Age 65-74: €6,700 total
- Age 75+: €8,100 total

**Married/Joint Filing:** +€3,400

**Children Allowances:**
- First child: +€2,400
- Second child: +€2,700
- Third+ children: +€4,000 each

**Example: Married couple, 2 children**
- Base: €5,550
- Married: +€3,400
- Child 1: +€2,400
- Child 2: +€2,700
- Total allowance: €14,050

On €50,000 gross:
- Taxable income: €50,000 - €14,050 = €35,950
- IRPF: ~€6,900 (vs €10,500 without allowances)
- Tax savings: ~€3,600/year

### FAQ placeholder

Answer placeholder

### Can I use this for autónomos (self-employed)?

Yes! Our calculator supports both empleados (employees) and autónomos (self-employed). Autónomos have different Social Security calculations using a progressive scale (€230-€1,536/month). Use the "Employment Type" advanced option.

### How accurate are the autonomous communities?

Our Spain salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits
- ✅ Autonomous communities with standard rates

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified Spanish tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Pension Contributions:** Private pension plans (Maximum: €1,500)
- **Health Insurance:** Private health insurance premiums (Maximum: €500)
- **Dependent Deductions:** Children and spouse allowances

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your IRPF.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Pension Contributions, etc.)
- Autonomous communitie of residence

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
