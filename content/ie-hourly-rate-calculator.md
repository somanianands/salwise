### Can I use this for self-employed individuals?

Yes! Our calculator supports both PAYE employees and self-employed individuals. Self-employed pay 4% PRSI instead of the employee rate and have different USC bands. You can claim allowable business expenses against income.

### How accurate are the calculations?

Our Ireland salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits


**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified Irish tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Pension Contributions:** Reduces taxable income (not USC/PRSI)
- **PAYE Credit:** €1,775 annual tax credit
- **Personal Credit:** €1,775 (single) or €3,550 (married)

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your IT.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Pension Contributions, etc.)

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
