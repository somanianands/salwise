### Can I use this for auto-entrepreneurs and freelancers?

Yes! The calculator supports both employees and auto-entrepreneurs. Self-employed under the micro-entrepreneur regime pay simplified social contributions (12.8-22% depending on activity). Standard self-employed pay full social charges (~45%).

### How accurate are the calculations?

Our France salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits


**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified French tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Family Quotient:** Married couples: 2 parts, +0.5 per child (1st-2nd), +1 per child (3rd+)
- **Professional Expenses:** 10% automatic deduction or actual expenses
- **Pension Contributions:** Supplementary pension schemes

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Income Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Family Quotient, etc.)

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
