### Can I use this for sole traders and contractors?

Yes! The calculator supports both employees and sole traders. Self-employed individuals don't have PAYG withholding but pay the same tax rates. You can deduct business expenses and must make quarterly PAYG installments.

### How accurate are the calculations?

Our Australia salary calculator uses official 2026/2027 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits


**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified Australian tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Superannuation:** Employer contributes 11.5% (not deducted from salary)
- **LITO:** Low and Middle Income Tax Offset (up to $700)
- **Work-Related Expenses:** Tools, uniforms, professional development

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Income Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Superannuation, etc.)

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
