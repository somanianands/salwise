### Can I use this for self-employed and sole traders?

Yes! The calculator handles both employees (PAYE) and self-employed individuals. Self-employed pay Class 2 (£3.45/week) and Class 4 (9% on £12,570-£50,270, 2% above) National Insurance instead of Class 1 employee NI.

### How accurate are the regions?

Our United Kingdom salary calculator uses official 2026/2027 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits
- ✅ Regions with standard rates

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified UK tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Pension Contributions:** Workplace pension scheme (Maximum: £60,000)
- **Gift Aid Donations:** Charitable donations
- **Marriage Allowance:** Transfer £1,260 of personal allowance to spouse

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Income Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Pension Contributions, etc.)
- Region of residence

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
