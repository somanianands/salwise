### FAQ placeholder

Answer placeholder

### Can I use this for freelancers and partita IVA?

Yes! The calculator works for both dipendenti (employees) and autonomi/freelancers. Self-employed individuals pay 25.97% INPS (capped at €113,520 income) instead of 9.19% employee rate. You can deduct business expenses to reduce taxable income.

### How accurate are the regions?

Our Italy salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits
- ✅ Regions with standard rates

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified Italian tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **Personal Deduction:** Income-dependent deduction up to €1,880
- **Dependent Deductions:** Spouse (up to €800) and children (€950-€1,220 each)
- **Healthcare Expenses:** Deductible medical expenses

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your IRPEF.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (Personal Deduction, etc.)
- Region of residence

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
