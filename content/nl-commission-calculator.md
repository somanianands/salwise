- Additional deductions or withholdings

- Timing of payments (tax is calculated annually but paid periodically)

### Can I use this for zzp'ers (self-employed)?

Yes! The calculator handles both employees and zzp'ers (self-employed). Self-employed don't pay employee social security but must pay income tax and arrange own insurance. You can deduct business expenses and qualify for self-employed deduction (zelfstandigenaftrek).

### How accurate are the calculations?

Our Netherlands salary calculator uses official 2026 tax rates and is highly accurate for standard employment situations. Accuracy is approximately 95-99% for most users.

**What affects accuracy:**
- ✅ Standard employees with straightforward income
- ✅ Common deductions and credits


**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Complex investment income or capital gains
- ⚠️ Multiple income sources or jobs
- ⚠️ Unique tax credits or situations
- ⚠️ Self-employment with complex expenses

For final tax advice, consult a qualified Dutch tax professional or accountant.

### What deductions can I add?

Our calculator supports common pre-tax deductions:

- **General Tax Credit:** Algemene heffingskorting (max €3,362)
- **Labor Tax Credit:** Arbeidskorting (max €5,533)
- **30% Ruling:** For expats with specific skills (30% tax-free)

Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income, which can significantly lower your Income Tax.

### Should I negotiate gross or net salary?

**Always negotiate gross salary.** Employment contracts specify gross amounts, and taxes vary by personal circumstances.

**Example:** Two people with the same gross salary may have different net salaries based on:
- Filing status (single vs married)
- Number of dependents
- Pre-tax deduction elections (General Tax Credit, etc.)

Use our calculator to understand what different gross salaries mean for your take-home pay.
